Collection in C# represent a group of objects. By help of collection we perform various operations on objects like: 
->Store 
->Update   
->Delete 
->Retrive 
->Search

Collections standardize the way of which the objects are handled by your program. In other words, it contains a set of classes to contain elements in a generalized manner. With the help of collections, the user can perform several operations on objects like the store, update, delete, retrieve, search, sort etc.

Generic collection in C# is defined in System.Collection.Generic namespace. It provides a generic implementation of standard data structure like linked lists, stacks, queues, and dictionaries. These collections are type-safe because they are generic means only those items that are type-compatible with the type of the collection can be stored in a generic collection, it eliminates accidental type mismatches. Generic collections are defined by the set of interfaces and classes. Below table contains the frequently used classes of the System.Collections.Generic namespace

Types of Collections:
There are three different ways to work with Collections.
